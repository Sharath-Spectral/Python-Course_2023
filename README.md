# Analysis of transmission electron microscopy multidimensional data using python library Hyperspy

Hyperspy can used for a wide variety of data analysis in transmission electron microsocopy such as Image processing, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) etc.

In this project I will be focussing on the analysis of electron energy loss spectroscopy data (EELS), using Jupyter notebook.
